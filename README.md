# Who should I vote for?

## Assumptions and caveats

Measurements are offset from 1 year after a party takes power, to allow for
changes due to previous administration. Obviously for some changes, such as
investment in primary school education, which take over a decade to pay returns
this is totally unrealistic.

Much of the data is scraped and therefore probably has errors.

And this is only looking at quantifiable data and there it does not take into
qualititative reasons to support a party.
